# AI Museum Guide Frontend

## Quick Start

The application is experiencing configuration issues with the React development server. To see the frontend working:

### Option 1: Use Simple Version

npm start
```

If you see a white screen, try the simplified components we've created.

### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
cd frontend
npx react-scripts start --disable-host-check
```

### Option 3: Update and Clean Start
```bash
cd frontend
npm install --force
npx create-react-app . --template typescript
npm start
```
